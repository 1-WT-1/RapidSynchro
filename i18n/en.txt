SYSTEM_SYNCHRO_RAPID|Staccato Particle Projector

SYSTEM_SYNCHRO_RAPID_DESC|The Staccato Particle Projector is an Omaewamou-Shindeiru design that re-engineers conventional synchrotron function for rapid, sequential ejections. Instead of a prolonged buildup for a single high-energy pulse, the Staccato utilizes a high-frequency resonant cavity injector synchronized with a rapidly cycling magnetic deflection system. This allows for the continuous acceleration and ejection of smaller, discrete particle packets at a high repetition rate. though at a lower terminal velocity compared to single-shot collider designs. \n\nThis intense operational mode subjects the accelerator's core components to extreme cyclic stresses. As these stresses accumulate with sustained fire, energy containment becomes less coherent, manifesting as visible arcing and parasitic plasma discharges from the weapon casing. To prevent irreversible damage from exceeding material tolerances, an automated regulation system will force a temporary shutdown and re-stabilization cycle if operational limits are breached. This weapon is restricted in densely populated systems due to its high energy signature and operational demands. Enceladus Prime has not yet finalized specific regulations.
